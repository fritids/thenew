Highlight your code, Dreamweaver style.

== Description ==

= BETA =
The plugin is currently in beta-phase. While everything should work as intended, unexpected things might happen!

= Description =
This plugin supports the highlighting of CSS, (x)HTML, JavaScript, XML and PHP. The default tag-highlighter
color scheme uses the same colors Adobe's Dreamweaver is using. This makes it easy for your visitors to
recognize what type of codes you wrote. These colors can be changed to your liking in the WPadmin section
of your blog.
